# **The landing was developed on the basis of the layout in Figma.**

## The following methods were used: 
  - HTML;
  - JS;
  - SCSS - a preprocessor for CSS that extends its capabilities with features like variables, mixins, and nested styles;
  - BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) - a methodology for naming and organizing SCSS classes to create structured and reusable code;
  - Flexbox - a module for creating flexible layouts on web pages;
  - Icon Fonts - fonts that include sets of icons and symbols that can be used on web pages instead of individual image files;
  - @import, @font-face;
  - Media queries.
